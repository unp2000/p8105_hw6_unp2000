# Regression Model

Creating Initial Regression Model:

Variables were selected based on a literature search of predictors of
low birthweight. Based on this, babysex, gaweeks, momage, mheight,
parity, ppbmi, pnumlbw, and smoken were selected as variables to include
in the
model.

``` r
bw_model1 = lm(bwt ~ babysex + gaweeks + momage + mheight + parity + ppbmi + pnumlbw + smoken, data = child_data)
```

Plotting residuals against fitted values:

``` r
plot_1 = child_data %>%
  modelr::add_residuals(bw_model1) %>%
  modelr::add_predictions(bw_model1) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = pred, y = resid)) + geom_point (color = "blue") 
```
